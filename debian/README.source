Important: source packages dask and dask.distributed upstream version
must be kept synchronous!

This is important for the consistency of the set of dask Python modules.
In most cases, loss of synchronisation with upstream version will cause
test regressions in dask.distributed.  But, as long as dask.distributed
autopkgtest is marked as flaky, debci will not be able to raise alarms
to flag the regression properly, and it risks making its way in testing.
